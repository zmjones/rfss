This repository contains the code, data, and manuscript for "[Exploratory Data Analysis Using Random Forests](http://zmjones.com/static/papers/rfss_manuscript.pdf)" by [Zachary M. Jones](http://zmjones.com) and [Fridolin Linder](http://polisci.la.psu.edu/people/fjl128).

> Machine learning techniques gain in popularity in many disciplines and increased computational power allows for easy implementation of such algorithms. However, they are still widely considered as "black box" models that are not suited for substantive research. We present one such method, random forests, with emphasis on practical application for exploratory analysis and substantive interpretation. Random forests detect interaction and nonlinearity without prespecification, have low generalization error, do not overfit, and can be used with many correlated predictors. Importantly, they can be interpreted in a substantively relevant way via measures of marginal variable importance and the partial dependence algorithm. We provide intuition as well as technical detail about how random forests work, in theory and in practice, as well as an empirical example from the literature on comparative politics. We also provide software to facilitate the substantive interpretation of random forests and guidance on when random forests may be useful.

The associated software package, which is functional but still under development is [edarf](http://github.com/zmjones/edarf/). Feel free to open issues or issue pull requests. We welcome corrections or suggestions large or small.
