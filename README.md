This repository contains the code, data, and manuscript for "[Exploratory Data Analysis Using Random Forests](http://zmjones.com/static/papers/rfss_manuscript.pdf)" by [Zachary M. Jones](http://zmjones.com) and [Fridolin Linder](http://polisci.la.psu.edu/people/fjl128).

> As computational power has increased machine learning algorithms have seen wider use in many disciplines, however, they are still widely considered to be "black box" models that are not suited for substantive research: only prediction. We argue that this need not be the case, and present one method, random forests, with an emphasis on practical application for exploratory analysis and substantive interpretation. Random forests detect interaction and nonlinearity without prespecification, have low generalization error, do not overfit, and can be used with many correlated predictors. Importantly, they can be interpreted in a substantively relevant way with measures of variable importance, partial dependence, and several other methods. We provide intuition as well as technical detail about how random forests work, in theory and in practice, as well as an empirical example from the literature on comparative politics. We also provide software to facilitate the substantive interpretation of random forests and guidance on when random forests may be useful.

The associated software package, which is functional but still under development is [edarf](http://github.com/zmjones/edarf/). Feel free to open issues or issue pull requests. We welcome corrections or suggestions large or small.
